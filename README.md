### Data Visualization: Academic Literature on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Reproductive Medicine in the US
The dataset we are using was explored in the July 2023 article Racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine in the United States: a narrative review of contemporary high-quality evidence, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in January 2025. The original paper focuses on racial and ethnic inequities in ob/gyn. The dataset suggestion is credited to Kat Correia from Amherst College.

The dataset consists of two related tables, article_dat.csv and model_dat.csv. article_dat.csv contains metadata for articles published in medical journals, including bibliographic identifiers (PubMed ID, DOI), journal details, publication date, and study characteristics. The model_dat.csv file focuses on statistical models within these articles: model numbers, stratification details, subanalysis, outcome measures, effect size estimates (e.g., odds ratio, risk ratio), covariates, and confidence intervals.
